        &lt;p&gt;So finally i bought two new domains,one for myself and another one for my dad.After  days of hunting for the most creative domains and its availability,i have registered &lt;code&gt;winay dot in&lt;/code&gt; from gandi.net
inspired from &lt;a href=&#34;https://wisharya.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Vishal Arya&lt;/a&gt;,i always wanted to buy a domain for myself,had been hunting for the creative one since college, and finally i registered one.
i have also bought another domain for my dad &lt;code&gt;smpdiesel dot in&lt;/code&gt;,which is a diesel generator service based company.I was able to convince my dad to use GNU/Linux, he now uses Debian 12 on this PC, and its super speed with low specs.In coming days i will configure the DNS to this site, and self host few applications for my personal use.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t grow up old, everyone wants to become an adult soon, enjoy life ,stay independent,take more responsibilites etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this process, you miss out a lot of things,the excitement to grow old faster kills you, and you will only realize this when you look behind and regret saying, i should have done this at that point of time in my life, but you cannot do it now,and now do nothing but,regretting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t let the kid inside you miss out the fun,enjoy every moment in life to the fullest,enjoy by living the present moment.
Do what you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to do at that point of time in your life.
What ever is supposed to happen,happens at the right time,irrespective of what and how many times you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;2023 is about to end in another few months,I feel ,i should write more now!.
I just love writing now,I feel i should write more to express my thoughts,ideas,its been since few months i started to write more &lt;a href=&#34;/docs&#34; &gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;,and i just simply love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like it helps me document stuff,check how my learning evolved over time and its progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first when i started to create my portfolio i was reluctant to write much,barely one or two articles per year,i was not confident about my grammer too,now i really dont care about it,i just write my raw thoughts.There&amp;rsquo;s some level of satisfaction of writing,i encourage others also to write more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who read my blog might provide feedback too,correct if any mistakes.
I also encourage other people to write, if they are too shy they can try anonymous blog.&lt;/p&gt;
