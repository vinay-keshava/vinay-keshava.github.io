      <description>I am excited to share with you all that I have recently become a Debian maintainer!! Thanks to amazing debian community.
It all started with Software Freedom Camp, ravish my college super senior (we were a part of college linux club) introduced me to software freedom camp organized by FSCI, since then i was a noob hopping between various distro&amp;rsquo;s from kali linux to other debian based distros to arch !</description>
