        &lt;p&gt;I am excited to share with you all that I have recently become a &lt;a href=&#34;https://nm.debian.org/process/1173/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Debian maintainer&lt;/a&gt;!!
Thanks to amazing debian community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started with &lt;a href=&#34;https://camp.fsci.in&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Software Freedom Camp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravish0007.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ravish&lt;/a&gt; my college super senior (we were a part of college linux club) introduced me to software freedom camp organized by FSCI, since then i was a noob hopping between various distro&amp;rsquo;s from kali linux to other debian based distros to arch !
I had previously written my experience of attending software freedom camp &lt;a href=&#34;https://vinay-keshava.gitlab.io/posts/softwarefreedomcamp2021snikket/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with packaging node modules initially without any knowledge of javascript/nodejs, before packaging new module i tried to upgrade few node packages to new upstream,it was difficult at first understanding the packaging process. &lt;a href=&#34;https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/node-prosemirror-view&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;node-prosemirror-view&lt;/a&gt; was the first node module i packaged, cut to 20&#39;23, i maintain few ruby and golang packages most of them which are gitlab dependencies, here is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=vinaykeshava@disroot.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of packages i maintain.Special  thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://social.masto.host/@praveen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;praveen&lt;/a&gt; for his mentoring, who is my package sponsorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/dm_praveen.png&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; style=&#34;width:400px;height:auto;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past six months, I have been  packaging Ruby gems and GitLab dependencies. For this gitlab update, I took on the challenge of building GitLab 15.8.4 and its major components, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://salsa.debian.org/go-team/packages/gitaly/-/tree/upstream/15.8.4&amp;#43;dfsg1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gitlay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://salsa.debian.org/go-team/packages/gitlab-shell/-/tree/upstream/14.15.0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitLab-shell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Praveen and Bilal for their help and support during gitlab package upgrade to 15.8.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first package as DM uploaded was &lt;a href=&#34;https://salsa.debian.org/ruby-team/ruby-et-orbi/-/tree/debian/1.2.7-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ruby-et-orbi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also preparing GitLab for bookworm, the next release of Debian.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Software Freedom Camp 2021 Snikket</title>

        &lt;p&gt;Back to writing after a 2-month long Semester End Exam !!!!.&lt;br&gt;
Everyone uses messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook, Signal, Telegram, and various other applications to communicate with people, in this blog post I would like to introduce to XMPP Protocol( Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol), &lt;strong&gt;XMPP&lt;/strong&gt; is an open, decentralized universal messaging standard for instant messaging, voice/video calls.   Many Applications or Clients are built using the XMPP protocol due to its open nature. Platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal impose vendor lock-in wherein the user using the product or service cannot transit to the competitor’s product/service. To overcome vendor lock-in issues and privacy issues one of the minimal, simple best solutions is to set up a Snikket server of your own, where you can own your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is Snikket&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://snikket.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Snikket&lt;/a&gt; is a simple, customized messaging platform that is different from other messaging apps like Whatsapp, Telegram. Snikket is a decentralized messaging platform which means anyone can host their snikket server on their cloud, it allows everyone to host their server.   &lt;br&gt;
Snikket is free software, a privacy-friendly messaging platform based on XMPP protocol, it can be self-hosted by anyone. Snikket provides an android application client to connect to any XMPP servers and using a snikket account you choose any XMPP clients if you want to connect using android applications like monocles chat, blabber, Snikket app other desktop clients recommended are dino-im and gajim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Experience of Running Snikket Server&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snikket is my first self-hosted service, before talking about the experience of running the snikket server I would like to talk about &lt;a href=&#34;https://camp.fsci.in/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Software Freedom camp 2021 &lt;/a&gt;,the camp is organized by the Free Software Community of India. As a part of the camp initially, learners were made to understand the philosophy and intention behind free software. Later during the project phase, learners were allowed to choose certain available topics proposed by the mentor. &lt;br&gt;
After joining the sfcamp as a learner, I choose to learn system administration and Debian packaging, under system administration one of the deliverables was to set up a Snikket server of my own.&lt;br&gt;
To run any snikket server basic requirements are a domain name and a VPS (Virtual Private Server )to run your snikket server. I had signed up for the Github Student Developer pack through the pack got the free domain from name.com and I choose Amazon Web Services Free Tier as my VPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;code-block relative mt-6 first:mt-0 group/code&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Snikket is all about the
        DNS
        Docker
        Daemons&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;opacity-0 transition group-hover/code:opacity-100 flex gap-1 absolute m-[11px] right-0 top-0&#34;&gt;
    &lt;button
      class=&#34;code-copy-btn group/copybtn transition-all active:opacity-50 bg-primary-700/5 border border-black/5 text-gray-600 hover:text-gray-900 rounded-md p-1.5 dark:bg-primary-300/10 dark:border-white/10 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:text-gray-50&#34;
      title=&#34;Copy code&#34;
    &gt;
      &lt;div class=&#34;group-[.copied]/copybtn:hidden copy-icon pointer-events-none h-4 w-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&#34;hidden group-[.copied]/copybtn:block success-icon pointer-events-none h-4 w-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snikket also has an option of creating circles, limiting users to that circle only, although any user can talk to any individual by providing an XMPP or Snikket username. Snikket uses an invite-based procedure for account creation on the server. Only the admin can have the authority to create an invite link. Snikket also supports audio and video calls of great speed, these are some of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://snikket.org/app/features/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;features&lt;/a&gt; of the snikket application. I have been using Snikket and invited most of my friends to my Snikket server. Initially, it took time to make them understand how it is completely different from other messaging platforms. Later educated them about how decentralization, vendor lock-in works and then introduced them to Snikket and other XMPP-based clients.&lt;br&gt;
The learning while setting up the snikket server was got introduced to Docker Container, Domain Name System( DNS ), how server logs are checked, and debugging the errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Guide to Setup Snikket Server&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the quickstart guide to setup the &lt;a href=&#34;https://snikket.org/service/quickstart/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;snikket server &lt;/a&gt;, this is the official guide by Snikket to setup the snikket server .
The detailed documentation is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/snikket-im/snikket-server/tree/master/docs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Snikket requires few ports to be open for communication refer &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/snikket-im/snikket-server/blob/master/docs/advanced/firewall.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this &lt;/a&gt; which clearly mentions the firewall rules and ports required.

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravish0007.github.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ravish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.sahilister.in&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sahil&lt;/a&gt; for helping to set up the Snikket server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Next Goals&lt;/h1&gt; - Reverse Proxy by Nginx .
&lt;p&gt;Bye for now .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;code-block relative mt-6 first:mt-0 group/code&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    :wq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;opacity-0 transition group-hover/code:opacity-100 flex gap-1 absolute m-[11px] right-0 top-0&#34;&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Ahh, my first blog post.   Good Beginnings  (:&lt;br&gt;
Excited!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post is dedicated to sharing my experience with updating the FSCI’s GitLab instance &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.fosscommunity.in/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;git.fosscommunity.in&lt;/a&gt; update.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://fsci.in/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FSCI&lt;/a&gt; runs a free instance of GitLab Community Edition at &lt;a href=&#34;https://git.fosscommunity.in&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;git.fosscommunity.in&lt;/a&gt; for collaborative software development.&lt;br&gt;
FSCI also hosts and maintains a lot of services for the community, you can check out the services &lt;a href=&#34;https://fsci.in/#poddery&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, these services are managed by volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After joining  &lt;a href=&#34;https://camp.fsci.in&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software Freedom Camp 2021 Diversity Edition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;( Online mentorship programme organized by Free Software Community of India(FSCI) ) as a learner and I met a bunch of people who discuss about &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravidwivedi.in/posts/free-software-explained-simply/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Free/Libre/Open Source Software&lt;/a&gt; and educate people about why it is important to use free software in our life maintaining freedom and privacy in this era of technology.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravish0007.github.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ravish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.sahilister.in&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sahilister&lt;/a&gt;  we all updated it from GitLab v14.4.2 to Gitlab v14.4.4 it was a Security update, it took a lot of my time to update and upgrade the instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All thanks to  &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravish0007.github.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ravish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.sahilister.in&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Sahilister&lt;/a&gt; for helping and teaching me.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Cheers to 23,my another year of existence on this planet.
A wonderful day filled with wishes from friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;code-block relative mt-6 first:mt-0 group/code&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Time Flies. Time Flies faster every year.
Time Flies whether you&amp;#39;re having fun or not, 
whether you&amp;#39;re living your life big or small,
whether you surround yourself with fear or Laughter - Claire Cook&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;opacity-0 transition group-hover/code:opacity-100 flex gap-1 absolute m-[11px] right-0 top-0&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its exactly been an year since i was graduated from my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree.Last year at this point of time, was with my friends for the last trip of engineering.We had our convocation last month,after months of graduating. Wrote a separate blog post about attending the college &lt;a href=&#34;/blog/convocation&#34; &gt;convocation&lt;/a&gt;.
These days the weekends is mostly to meet up college &amp;amp; hostel friends to chit chat about how we miss our good old days :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yayy i started reading books,the first book i read was &lt;code&gt;When Breath Becomes Air&lt;/code&gt; by Paul Kalanithi gifted by my friend.Currently reading &lt;code&gt;IKIGAI&lt;/code&gt; the japanese way of living life.I also wish to write a summary/review of the books i read if i find time over weekends.I also started loving to write more blog posts about the things happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve messed up my &lt;a href=&#34;https://nm.debian.org/1243&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Debian Developer process&lt;/a&gt;, i regret it and i hope to contribute more time to debian and i wish to become one atleast in the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have a huge pending list of tasks to be done,mostly learning stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly thanking family &amp;amp; friends for supporting me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bye!!!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Now graduated from &lt;a href=&#34;https://aiet.org.in&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Alva&amp;rsquo;s Institute of Engineering &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/a&gt; in Computer Science!!
On 06th April 2024 approximately an year after our farewell, our &lt;a href=&#34;https://aiet.org.in&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;college&lt;/a&gt; conducted convocation to distribute our degree certificates :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all were excited to meet our friends,its been almost an year we met everyone!
It was a scorching summer saturday in mangalore, had to report to college at 9:00am to collect my semester marks card and degree certificate.Chinmay picked me up from mangalore.After clearing our no dues we received our marks card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had time till afternoon for the program to start, had a quick breakfast at moodbidri and headed to Kanchi bail waterfalls near Gundyadka, just to find out that the water has been dried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/convocation.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Graduated Me!!&#34; style=&#34;width:230px;height:370px;&#34;&gt;
That&#39;s me sweating because of the humidity. Clicked few pictures with my friends and said them bye,would meet them in bangalore.
&lt;p&gt;The next day,we visited Swamy Koragajja Aadisthala Temple, Ullal Mangalore &amp;amp; Kadri Manjunatha Temple with Ganesh and Abhishek, and then we started heading towards Kundapura.We visited the Kapu Beach Lighthouse afternoon, sadly we couldn&amp;rsquo;t play in water,it was too humid, barely able to walk or sit beside the beach.
We were trying to stay hydrated as much as possible to beat the heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/kadri.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Kadri Manjunath Temple&#34; style=&#34;width:260px;height:470px;&#34;&gt;
Picture: Kadri Manjunath Temple

Picture: [From Left] Abhishek,Ganesh &amp; Me
&lt;p&gt;Had our lunch at Eshanya Restaurant in Kundapura and they dropped me at the bus stop, i had to go back to mangalore to catch the train to reach bangalore. I was just accompanying my friends till Kundapura,because i had no work or plans till evening. Waved a bye at Ganesh &amp;amp; Abhishek and came back to mangalore by express bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Met darshan and manoj at the City Centre Mall, we all were boarding the same train.We waited for Megha and Nadiya to join us who were also boarding the same train.
I still had a few more hours of time left to catch the train.The seat was not confirmed it was in waiting list,had been checking it since morning and finally an RAC was confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe will write another blog post to tell about engineering and hostel experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then Bye!!!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;What I Learnt Yesterday(WILY)&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-i-learnt-yesterdaywily&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-i-learnt-yesterdaywily&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;WILY is a name I rephrased to log all my daily learnings.I started this two months ago, where I log about what I learnt yesterday.Everyday is a learning day it can be tech, some commands or some life lessons experienced throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired from  &lt;a href=&#34;https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Zettelkasten&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point of time in our lives we would want to relearn a few things after a few days/weeks but the effort to find resources for a specific topic can be time consuming.
I learnt a lot of stuff during engineering but I don&amp;rsquo;t remember any thing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was using Notion as my documentation app, used to make notes within a notion workspace,it has an option to export to PDF and also share an article with a public link.
Then I found this beautiful hextra hugo theme, where i can design to my custom look and needs. Took a few weeks to setup this theme locally,with the help of the hextra  theme maintainer on GitHub.
Now everytime I learn something new i write and save it in a markdown file, so thats its easy to add back to the docs.
I also love the &lt;code&gt;docs&lt;/code&gt; feature of this theme,making it beautiful and easy to search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish to log all my daily learnings with more sincere effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you until next time.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;Awakening&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;awakening&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#awakening&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kumara Parvatha 😍 ,the highest peak in Pushpagiri Wildlife sanctuary,the best and worst trekking we had ever experienced.It all started with my school friends who were planning for a long trip after graduating from engineering (Most of them are Engineers,few are doctors),the last time i went to a long trip with my school friends was a visit to Waynad,Kerala (10th School Trip).After completing my intermediate,i migrated to moodbidri for my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree and all my friends pursued their engineering in bangalore,this was the reason it took more time for me to go for a trip with them, during engineering i rarely used to come home,maybe 6 months once so it was difficult to plan for a long trip with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I,dharnish,rohan,chandan started hunting for places to plan for the trip,and after a lot of discussions and budget restrictions we decided &amp;ldquo;A Trek To Kumara Parvatha&amp;rdquo; on Jan 5th,2024 should be good enough, after great grand new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We booked our train tickets one month before,so that we aren&amp;rsquo;t cancelling the trip this time, after so many cancellations at the last minute from my side too :) . We also had booked our tents at Battru Mane for one night stay on Jan 6th Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would suggest this trek to kumara parvatha,if one wants to experience the value of a sip of water and rice grain.
The only fear we had was,are we capable and fit enough to trek, because kumara parvatha had the level of difficulty from moderate to difficult,which has total trek distance of approx 24KM,which has to be covered in two days according to our plan and a stay at Battru Mane for one night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day before our train, we had to shop clothes and a lot of snacks to survive while trekking and few medicines for emergency purpose.
With all set for trek, we all were excited for the trek&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/kumara-parvatha/kp-train-jan5-24.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; style=&#34;width:500px;height:auto;&#34;&gt;
         	That&#39;s us from left Me, Dharnish, Chandan and Rohan
&lt;p&gt;We boarded our train on Jan 5th,2024 9:00pm at Majestic,Bengaluru and it would reach Subhramanya Road around 6:00am the next day, during the train journey we had some good conversations about school memories, cherishing the moments we did in school, talks about Reddy Sir, school friends and a lot of things during the train journey.We were speaking till midnight and then realized we had to sleep soon, so that we can take rest to start afresh to trek.
We reached Subhramanya Road Railway Station around 5:45am and had to board a KSRTC bus to reach Kukke Subhramanya Temple which was around 10-12km from the railway station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/kumara-parvatha/kumaradhara_river.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; style=&#34;width:500px;height:auto;&#34;&gt;
The picture is the holy river called Kumaradhara river, piligrims take a dip in this holy river and then head to the darshan for Kukke Subhramanya.
We took a holy dip at kumaradhara river,even though it was cold, we were shivering after taking the bath.It was cold af.
After a holy bath in the Kumaradhara River near Kukke Subhramanya Temple, we started heading to Temple for the darshan.
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/kumara-parvatha/kukke.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; style=&#34;width:500px;height:auto;&#34;&gt;
[A picture of ourselves infront of the temple,from left Rohann,Mee,Dharnishaa,Chandann, we look cool right?,i just love this picture, School friends are &lt;3 ]
&lt;p&gt;After the darshan and we had our breakfast at a hotel nearby,we had to eat to our stomach full because the next point where we get food during the trek was Battru Mane which was 6km from the trek starting point.Later we realised we bought a lot of baggage which would make us tiring to trek along with carrying the bagge,so we wasted our time deciding and segregating where to put our baggages so that it is safe for atleast 2 days.We then finally found a place at the KSRTC bus stop since it was a paid service,we trusted it 😜.By the time we segregated and deposited our baggage at the KSRTC counter it was afternoon.
I just hydrated myself with some juice, and then we started heading to the trek start point and Forest Office.It is around 2km walk from the temple to the trek start point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trek Start Point - Forest Office&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;trek-start-point---forest-office&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#trek-start-point---forest-office&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly around 2km walk from the temple,we reached the Forest Office and Trek Starting Point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good initiative taken by the Forest office was to not dispose any plastics on the way to the trek.At the start of the trek point all the bags are checked thoroughly and the number of plastics are counted with chocolate wrappers counted too.We had a lot of plastics because it was mostly eatables, the total count of plastics was 90 + 4 90 numbers of plastics and 4 water bottles for each of us and if any plastic piece is left on the hill during the trek the forest office informed us that they would charge a Rs.50 per plastic,if any plastic is missed out we would go bankrupt 😢 , so we were careful about not littering the plastics anywhere.
The excitement was very high at the first while walking along the trails,clicking pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found a group of 2 people who were trekking to KP, and the coincidence was even they were from Bangalore,and they were kannadigas.We started trekking along with them,making funny jokes with them,we were comparing our trekking speed with recent version of engines like BS4 , BS5 😉, they were few years elder to us.Whenever they were taking rest we use to tease them to upgrade their BS engines😄.
Their baggage was very less compared to ours,they only had a small bag and a water bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started to feel tired, at first the JOSH was high,but then we were taking frequent breaks while trekking,We started feeling thirsty, our bottles were empty after a few hours of trekking, we had bought a TANG packet to stay hydrated while trekking.
Legs started aching, it was very humid, with all these the only motivation for boys is girls😄, there was girl gang who was trekking along with us.
Since it was the only way to trek to the top of the hill and get down from the hill, we were asking people who were coming down,how much time it takes to reach Battru Mane,few people were scaring us saying there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to trek more to reach battru mane,while few were motivating, but we didn&amp;rsquo;t know whom to believe.
It was scorching heat and had to bear until we found the path to the water falls,near Bheemana Bande.
Empty Bottles,thirsty throat,hungry stomach with birdy butterflies, this was our situation after a trekking for 2Kms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bheemana Bande | Bheema Rock&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;bheemana-bande--bheema-rock&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bheemana-bande--bheema-rock&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bheemana Bande translates to Bheema&amp;rsquo;s Rock.
Bheemana Bande,a beautiful place with simple view with a small stream of water, a much needed place to rest, soaking our feet in the cold water to feel the relaxation.
We had our lunch at bheema&amp;rsquo;s rock bought by rohan,we were more hungry so we started eating few sneakers by carefully peeling the wrapper of the chocolate and not littering it out.I think we were more careful about the plastic wrappers than our lives at that point of time.
After having our lunch, we took rest for a few minutes and we wanted to drink water,since it was the only water resource until we reach Battru Mane which is like 3 to 4 KM from the Bheema&amp;rsquo;s rock. So i and chandan went to the top of the hill hunting for the fresh water.After taking a long rest we decided to leave and reach Battru mane before sunset, so that we aren&amp;rsquo;t stuck in dark&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Battru Mane&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;battru-mane&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#battru-mane&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We left Bheema&amp;rsquo;s rock at around 2:30 pm,After a long rest we started trekking back again, the trails had more elevation had to put longer steps,making us more tired and take frequent rests.For every 15 to 20 minutes we were taking rest for a period of 10mins
Legs started aching badly,we were taking more breaths per second.The trails had more elevation,it wasn&amp;rsquo;t flat,may be with an angle of 30 degrees.Number of steps become more.
We badly needed water, our throats were dried up.We were saving the snacks for the 2nd day trek because there&amp;rsquo;s no food resources after battru mane,we were planning to leave battru mane early morning so that we could complete the trek by next day evening.
We had no more energy left out, rohan was badly tired taking more breaks.
Everyone were tired even to quit and go back,we have to cover back the distance back,instead it was better to continue to battru mane, only option left out.
After 3 hours of trekking, we reached battru mane at around 5:40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/kumara-parvatha/bm1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; style=&#34;width:300px;height:380px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/kumara-parvatha/bm2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; style=&#34;width:300px;height:380px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Thats chandan and me resting inside the &amp;ldquo;Patched&amp;rdquo; Tent]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally reached battru mane at around 5:40pm,there&amp;rsquo;s little internal satisfaction.
We were looking for the person called vasanth,with whom we booked our tents to stay tonight.As soon as we got our tents we rushed into it,to take rest.After little rest we went to meet battru to order our dinner, each plate costs around Rs.150&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also ordered food for the next day.There&amp;rsquo;s no list or menu the only thing we get is Rice and Sambar.Just like how we trekked from the base,the rice bag is carried on shoulders and then bought to battru mane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Battru Mane is the only place where you get food,and a proper flat surface to tent.
There were many people like us who had come to trekking and there were like around 50+ tents.
There wasn&amp;rsquo;t any phone signals too inform home that we have reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thought of taking a nap before having dinner.I and chandan were in one tent,rohan and dharnish in the other.It was cloudy by then,since it was summer we didnt expect that it would rain..
It was a one person tent looking at the size,but they fooled us and said two persons can stay,with no other option left and all other tents booked,we adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the cinema starts&amp;hellip;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone were tired trekking after a 6km trek,so we fell asleep soon.
I suddenly woke up to the sounds of thunderstorms,thats when i realised its raining heavily.
It was lighting and thunderstorm&amp;rsquo;ing heavily,but chandan was sleeping peacefully :)
At around 8:00pm tents started leaking, water was all over.We never experienced such a horrible night ever in our lives.
The tents were patched with tape,water started flowing inside but for time being we could sit inside.After a few minutes thunderstorms and rains increased, the tents were floating, we had water below the tents, we had the fear of getting washed away along with the tent. I shouted loudly to dharnish saying hope there isn&amp;rsquo;t any landslide (Dharnish &amp;amp; Rohan were in the tent next to us).Even their tents were leaking.Our bags are wet,we are wet, without having any other option for ourselves, we stayed within the tent. Few people who were standing near the pole experienced a slight lightning strike.
We were hungry on one side,raining on the other side,at 9:30pm finally i and rohan decided to check for the availability of the dinner at battru mane,its clumsy everywhere there was no place to stand even at battru mane,it was fully occupied with people just like us whose tents were leaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the person with whom we booked our tents so that atleast we could complain that the tents are leaking.
I and rohan took our bags along with us and went out,so that our bags wont get wet.After a little while dharnish and chandan joined us to check for the availability of the food.
Its 10:30pm and its still raining, butterflies in the stomach,tiredness after a long trek.After a few minutes it stopped raining. As soon as the rains stopped there was a long queue for the food.
People all around Battru Mane,standing in the queue for food while drizzling,for a minute it gave me AIET Hostel vibes while holding the plate and standing in the line.
While we were standing in the line there were a group of people with torch lights coming down the hill while it was raining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time we ate food it became 11:20pm, and the rain had stopped so we thought we could back to our tents and take rest atleast by sitting and floating within the tent.
But then here comes the another twist,one of our tents were occupied by other people, we tried re-checking whether if it was our tent,the next tent was the one where rohan and dharnish stayed, and rohan&amp;rsquo;s bottle was there lying, when we said them that it was our tent,kindly recheck with vasanth, they replied arrogantly that since you have the issue, you go and ask vasanth,i dont know where the hell was vasanth, there was no charge in our phone neither there was any light due power disconnection due to rains.
They said that they had been to the peak and had booked this tent afternoon,they were the one who were returning from the peak while we were stading in the queue.
Arguments went on for a while, we neither had energy to talk ,and then it started raining heavily, the tent next to rohan and dharnish&amp;rsquo;s was empty so we just bombarded into it.It was already 12:30am by that time,the tent which we bombarded was good enough so I,chandan,dharnish went inside,rohan said it would adjust to the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its 1:00 am we badly needed sleep,we were thinking of quitting and going back to the base morning after the breakfast,thinkging about the trails will be more slippery making it difficult to trek.In a one person tent we three slept,me horizontally,dharnish and chandan vertically.It was difficult to sleep there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any sufficient space to stretch our legs too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kallu Mantapa &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Sesha Parvatha&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;kallu-mantapa--sesha-parvatha&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#kallu-mantapa--sesha-parvatha&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a worst nightmare we got up around 4:30am because people were leaving battru mane and heading towards peak.We thought of quitting even at that point of time,but dharnish motivated us saying &amp;ldquo;lets go to the peak atleast till Kallu Mantapa and if we fail lets take rest for a while and return from kallu mantapa,there was no use taking so many risks and trekking 6km &amp;ldquo;.We decided to continue the trek,left battru mane around 4:45 heading towards forest office to pay the registration entry fee and Rs.500 as security fee.A little time was wasted while waiting to register. Torch lights on, trails wasn&amp;rsquo;t that slippery through the grasslands, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any leaches too.Started heading towards Kallu Mantapa with phone torch lights on. After a 2KM trek there was another forest office security check at another base, where our bags were checked, and also confirmed that our registration was also done.After one and half hour of trek the sun was rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticks in our hands,helping us to trek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Peak innu eshtu doora idiyo gothilla&amp;rdquo;,&amp;ldquo;Peak beda enu beda vapas hogona&amp;rdquo;, were some of the common dialogues by everyone.
No proper food,legs were aching, we were trekking for 10minutes,rest for 10 minutes i was the first person to get hit wicket.I couldn&amp;rsquo;t trek i badly needed some food,so had a pack of Britannia Cakes,so i was okayish after having the cakes,also after having snickers,kept the wrappers inside the bag.We were taking care of the wrappers like gold :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached the view point around 7:40am, took few pictures of ourselves and then started trekking to Kallu Mantapa thinking that it would become late.
Pictures from View point:
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/kumara-parvatha/viewpoint1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; style=&#34;width:200px;height:350px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/kumara-parvatha/viewpoint2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; style=&#34;width:500px;height:270px;&#34;&gt;
It was the best view ever,if given a chance we could have camped there.
&lt;p&gt;We skipped Kallu Mantapa, it was visible for us, but we lost the energy to go and come back from Kallu Mantapa so we thought of visiting while trekking down.So the next target for us Sesha Parvatha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many moments of Peak Banthu, Peak Banthu,we finally reached Sesha Parvatha at 8:50am, we took a lot of rest,ate snacks to our stomach full at the peak of Sesha Parvatha by enjoying the view.
When we initially reached Sesha Parvatha we assumed it was Kumara Parvatha,but later when other people informed us we got to know that we are the peak of sesha parvatha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AQf56-9y26I?si=t6MIfZzkhOt-0aKd&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence in the video was because had no energy to talk,after a long trek. EXHAUSEDTED&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thick Forest SP -&amp;gt; KP&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;thick-forest-sp---kp&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#thick-forest-sp---kp&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we left battru mane, we had to thought to quit after Kallu Mantapa but we reached till Sesha Parvatha,but then we were hungry more to trek so we decided to trek till Kumara Parvatha Peak which is 2Km from Sesha parvatha and this phase of the trek is the most difficult part. We started motivating ourselves and gave a try.
This thick dense forest shaped like a V between two the mountains Sesha Parvatha &amp;amp; Kumara Parvatha.Initially we have to get down from Sesha parvatha from one side and climb to Kumara Parvatha on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/kumara-parvatha/kp-forest-rohan-vinay.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; style=&#34;width:450px;height:280px;&#34;&gt;
[ Sesha parvatha to Kumara Parvatha through the thick forest,rohan checking his shoe (: ]
&lt;p&gt;This thick forest on the way to Kumara Parvatha is the best 1km trek with amazing weather and view.
You get to experience the nature&amp;rsquo;s beauty with your eyes, this part of the trek was only the interesting and satisfying part of the trek.Its just amazing even though its a hard trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/j15-W85O5mg?si=mOcMT9stnLxtSoUI&amp;amp;start=1&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here comes the next interesting and exciting part, this portion of climbing the hill rock was my favourite.I was excited for this.Our bottles were empty, so just filled water by the river stream before climbing the hill rock.
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/kumara-parvatha/kp-rock-trek.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; style=&#34;width:250px;height:400px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the water was not clean enough to drink, we had to drink water to make ourselves stay hydrated with TANG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A girl motivating chandan to climb the hill was another highlight of the trek [Update: We found the girl&amp;rsquo;s picture from Incredible Karnataka Instagram Post :) ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kumara Parvatha&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;kumara-parvatha&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#kumara-parvatha&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd Finallyyyyyyyyyyyyy there we go We reach KUMARAAANNA PARVATHA&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached the peak around 10:40am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/kumara-parvatha/kp-group.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; style=&#34;width:350px;height:600px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be frank the peak wasn&amp;rsquo;t that exiciting for the risk we had taken, there was just a board named &amp;ldquo;Pushpagiri Peak&amp;rdquo; surrounded by rocks also a temple within the vicinity of the peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/kumara-parvatha/peak-temple.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; style=&#34;width:300px;height:450px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/kumara-parvatha/kp-vinay.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; style=&#34;width:330px;height:550px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We half emptied our snacks,took blessings from temple. We left Pushpagiri Peak around 11:45 am.
The real challenge now is to trek down back,the distance we covered in one and half days, has to be covered in half day. We set ourselves a target to reach the base before sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trek Down&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;trek-down&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#trek-down&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9bON2Ff_eZA?si=nTzAp2aGw_RFi5Gm&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode 1,this was our very first Vlog,we had planned to make a series of videos,but due to time constraints we recorded only few videos,but i enjoy whenever i see this video(PS: It&amp;rsquo;s Pushpagiri Peak and Kumara Parvatha Peak sorry for the mistake in the video)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/moUxr_0WwSc?si=nzTQFoEEfU0e6QfQ&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Episode 2 the last one we had no energy to speak nor to record videos,so just decided to sum up everything into one.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We returned back to Battru Mane around 2:00pm,we had our hot lunch and left battru mane around 3:00pm, we have 3 hours of time to trek down to the base, which we had covered in 5 hours while climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no much interesting thing to write about trekking down because the only fear was whether we would reach the base before sunset.
I dont remember anything while getting down because we were hurrying ourselves,tiring ourselves to walk more,take less rests while trekking down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only interesting part was getting to know the instagram ID of a trek lead girl of Incredible Karnataka :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached the forest entry trek point around 6:45pm.No plastics were lost so we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to pay any money.Had our dinner at Kukke again,Here comes another struggle &amp;ldquo;Transport&amp;rdquo; to return back to bangalore. Since it was a sunday there was huge crowd and demand for bangalore buses,after searching for all possibilites we decided to board a KSRTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a bus scheduled at 8:30pm,it didn&amp;rsquo;t arrive on time so i was speaking to my friends Priya and other friends on a video call, and then suddenly chandan calls and asks us to board the bus,i and rohan started running towards the bus just to find there were no seats for me.Trekking for 24Km and no seat to sit was the hardest part.The good conductor offered me a seat next to him,seeing my struggles with my friends.I&amp;rsquo;m thankful to this man for offering the seat. It was an express bus,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached Majestic,Bangalore around 3:30 and reached our houses at 4:30am .Slept for 4 hours and went back to work,while all my other friends took a leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When i said my roomie Sathwik,that i had been to kumara parvatha successfully, his reaction was &amp;ldquo;Finally You Made it 😁 &amp;ldquo;,we did plan for kumara parvatha when we were in engineering but failed successfully 😝.I was that excited to trek to kumara parvatha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally a trip with school friends come to an end,with great memories and a bright smile on our faces for the best and worst trekking we had ever experienced.
So this is us and our story of &amp;ldquo;A Trek to Kumara Parvatha on Jan 6th,2024&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I hate uploading these videos to Youtube,still searching for a better alternative,this has been in draft for more than two months, so wanted to get rid of this from draft,once i get a server will learn &amp;amp; stream them,until then keep &amp;lt;3&amp;rsquo;ing FOSS ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you until next time,Byeeee.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;So finally i bought two new domains,one for myself and another one for my dad.After  days of hunting for the most creative domains and its availability,i have registered &lt;code&gt;winay dot in&lt;/code&gt; from gandi.net
inspired from &lt;a href=&#34;https://wisharya.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Vishal Arya&lt;/a&gt;,i always wanted to buy a domain for myself,had been hunting for the creative one since college, and finally i registered one.
I have also bought another domain for my dad &lt;code&gt;smpdiesel dot in&lt;/code&gt;,which is a diesel generator service based company.I was able to convince my dad to use GNU/Linux, he now uses Debian 12 on this PC, and its super speed with low specs.In coming days i will configure the DNS to this site, and self host few applications for my personal use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update: Feb 27,2024 the interesting part of the domain winay.in was the &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt; consists of two &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt;&amp;rsquo;s ,so its &lt;code&gt;vvinay.in&lt;/code&gt; ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Update March 28,2024 https://smpdiesel.in is up and running built with hugo static theme,and finally i&amp;rsquo;ve setup a website for my dad yayyyy!  ]&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t grow up old, everyone wants to become an adult soon, enjoy life ,stay independent,take more responsibilites etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this process, you miss out a lot of things,the excitement to grow old faster kills you, and you will only realize this when you look behind and regret saying, i should have done this at that point of time in my life, but you cannot do it now,and now do nothing but,regretting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t let the kid inside you miss out the fun,enjoy every moment in life to the fullest,enjoy by living the present moment.
Do what you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to do at that point of time in your life.
What ever is supposed to happen,happens at the right time,irrespective of what and how many times you think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Its almost been more than a month since &lt;a href=&#34;https://debconf23.debconf.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DebConf23&lt;/a&gt; happened,and this post was in draft for very long time because i just wanted to write the best post of all my post, and finally writing about the experience of attending a FOSS conference/conference for the first time.I had graduated in early May&#39;23, so was not sure whether i could attend DebConf.I had joined &lt;a href=&#34;https://deeproot.in/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Deeproot GNU/Linux&lt;/a&gt;,just before DebConf as an Intern.
I was excited for this because i meeting my Debian and &lt;a href=&#34;https://fsci.in&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Free Software Community of India&lt;/a&gt; friends for the first time in 2 years,i hadn&amp;rsquo;t met anyone physically,was conversing with them online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became a &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Debian Maintainer&lt;/a&gt; in early&#39;2023 March ,special thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://poddery.com/u/praveen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Praveen&lt;/a&gt; my GURU,for advocating my Debian Maintainer process,who taught me Debian Packaging from scratch,answering my stupid questions and &lt;a href=&#34;https://nileshpatra.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nilesh&lt;/a&gt; for signing my keys.
I have written a separate &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.vinay.im/blog/debian-maintainer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about my experience of becoming a DM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/ravish-debconf.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; style=&#34;width:400px;height:auto;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh so this is &lt;a href=&#34;https://ravish0007.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ravish&lt;/a&gt; [Left] and me. Ravish is my college super senior,we were part of FOSS club called Edwin&amp;rsquo;s Lab in our college,he&amp;rsquo;s the one who introduced me to GNU/Linux. Forever indebted to ravish its because of him i&amp;rsquo;m working at DeeprootLinux,Thanks man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my first time flying,I,&lt;a href=&#34;https://abhas.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Abhas - Founder of Deeproot Linux&lt;/a&gt;,Ravish boarded a cab to the Bangalore Airport, and we reached around 8:00pm,the architecture of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bengaluruairport.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;KIAL&lt;/a&gt; was just amazing,i was astonished, we had huge baggage to carry for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://mostlyharmless.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Mostly Harmless&lt;/a&gt; Stall at the airport,so we had rigourous security checks at the airport.
We boarded the flight on 9th September, DebConf was about to start from 10th September [ I missed DebCamp ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/debconf-flight.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;DebConf-Flight&#34; style=&#34;width:400px;height:300px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a surreal experience of flying for the first time,it was amazing feel.We also had our dinner (Veg Roll) on the flight.
Had the best view of city during the night time,watching&amp;rsquo;em from higher altitude was just so satisfying for eyes.
We reached Kochi Airport around 11:15pm and boarded a cab to Four Points Sheraton Hotel.
We reached Infopark Kochi around 12:30am and checked in to our hotels.I had applied for Accomodation and Food Bursary and it was approved :)
So my room was at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.booking.com/hotel/in/four-points-by-sheraton-kochi-infopark.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Four Points Sheraton Kochi&lt;/a&gt;,6th floor, also i was wondering who my roomate was,the earlier day i had receieved a mail that &lt;a href=&#34;kurianbenoy.com&#34; &gt;Kurian Benoy&lt;/a&gt; was my roommate, i was curious to meet him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning was DebConf Opening Ceremony,so had to sleep because it was already 3:00am i was exploring my hotel room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/debconf.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;DebConf&#34; style=&#34;width:400px;height:auto;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up around 8:00 am and freshened up and headed to FrontDesk for Registration,we got our name with GPG key printed on our ID&amp;rsquo;s,also got the SwagBag,with some cool stickers and swags by Debian.
After the registration i met kurian benoy, my roommate for a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/stickers.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;DebConf-Stickers&#34; style=&#34;width:400px;height:auto;&#34;&gt;
Stickers part of Debian Swag
&lt;p&gt;I and ravish were waiting at the HackLab for the opening ceremony,in mean time we met urbec,part of Video Team,had some good conversation too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEBCONF-23 starts with opening ceremony at Anamudi(These were the hall names,other hall names were Kuthiran,Ponmudi) the DebConf organizing team were on the stage giving a Welcome Note, and then after welcoming ceremony i went to attend talks which we interesting.
The talk schedule was not very tight, because we used to gather more at the eating place to meet new people from diverse countries,having some really good conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met praveen,shruti,anupa,ravi,sahil,abhijith,nilesh,bilal,suman,kelvin,pushkar,utkarsh,joostvb,Israel Galadima&amp;hellip; and lot more people whom i wanted to meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also met Pushkar from canonical, who used to stay at Bengaluru in the same locality and that was coincidence,meeting him was great too.
First day ended good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/debconf-group-photo-praveen-ravi.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Debconf Praveen Ravi&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/debconf-daytrip.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Debconf DayTrip&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;
On 13th Sep there&amp;rsquo;s a Day trip,but i hadn&amp;rsquo;t registered early, only for Bird Sanctuary the registration was open,just the day before day trip edited the wiki and added my name.
A Day trip to &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/DebConf/23/DayTrip/#Tour_D:_Destination_Wilderness:_Jungle_Walk_at_Thattekad_.28Early_Morning_Departure.29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Thattekad Bird Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; On the way to Thattekad i met /su/bin/ siby, on the bus.
Thattekad Bird Sanctuary is around 50km from the kochi,so we left around 7:00 am&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reached around 9:00 and had snacks and started walking towards the bird sanctuary.
It started with a walk around the bird sanctuary spotting for birds around,during the trek i was with Praveen,Bady,Kannan and Kelvin.
Spotting birds was difficult because it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the actual season for migrating birds,so we could spot only few.
Kelvin was explaining how he started to contribute to  Open Street Map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our way back to the bus it started raining heavily and we were drenched completely,
The &lt;a href=&#34;https://aana.site/@subins2000/111057301872140828&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;cool debian umbrella&lt;/a&gt; with Debian symbol on it,helped us to get back to the bus.After a hot tea and snacks we started back to kochi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/debian-in-the-cloud.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Debian Cloud&#34; style=&#34;width:350px;height:700px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debian and Clouds :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/mostly-harmless-stall.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mostly Harmless Stall&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;
The place were i stayed the most Mostly Harmless Stall (But not Harmless) with Abhas,Akshay explaining people about Liberated Hardware,and why it is important in life to use Liberated Hardware.Enjoyed Sahil&amp;rsquo;s touch typing and testing keyboards,i couldn&amp;rsquo;t take a picture with Sahil,he also volunteers at FSCI managing instances,he taught me &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.vinay.im/blog/git-fosscommunity-in-update&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;git.fosscommunity.in update&lt;/a&gt; generating keys etc he&amp;rsquo;s also a Debian Developer,part of DebConf organizing committe too, also met saswata from Unmukti Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an Amazing conference,it was my first Conference/FOSS conference enjoyed it,got to meet new people,the ecosystem of the Hacklab to hack around,seeing the community bonding even ravish wanted to contribute by packaging so taught him packaging at hacklab during free time,Also i learnt about OpenStreetMap,and now i map in and around Bangalore in my free time,a good hobby that i&amp;rsquo;m interested.Enjoyed ravi&amp;rsquo;s humourous jokes :) throughout DebConf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only disappointing thing at DebConf was the demise of &lt;a href=&#34;https://abrahamraji.in/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Abraham Raji&lt;/a&gt; during a Day Trip,&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.debian.org/News/2023/20230914&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Debian project mourns the death of abraham&lt;/a&gt;, i hadn&amp;rsquo;t personally met him,but conversed online about fsci camp,an inspiring soul&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham Lives Onnn!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;2023 is about to end in another few months,I feel ,i should write more now!.
I just love writing now,I feel i should write more to express my thoughts,ideas,its been since few months i started to write more &lt;a href=&#34;/docs&#34; &gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;,and i just simply love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like it helps me document stuff,check how my learning evolved over time and its progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first when i started to create my portfolio i was reluctant to write much,barely one or two articles per year,i was not confident about my grammer too,now i really dont care about it,i just write my raw thoughts.There&amp;rsquo;s some level of satisfaction of writing,i encourage others also to write more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who read my blog might provide feedback too,correct if any mistakes.
I also encourage other people to write, if they are too shy they can try anonymous blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;code-block relative mt-6 first:mt-0 group/code&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    :wq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;opacity-0 transition group-hover/code:opacity-100 flex gap-1 absolute m-[11px] right-0 top-0&#34;&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The Debian Graphical Installer,when i was introduced to Kali Linux(a Debian based distro),during my initial days of bachelor&amp;rsquo;s, the installer was so tricky to install GNU / Linux,thereby losing my data (:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though nowadays, Live systems have &lt;a href=&#34;https://calamares.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Calamares&lt;/a&gt;  based installer,i feel the Graphical Installer is a bit annoying,so i wanted to automate the debian installer using a preseed configuration file,giving answers to debian installer in a config file making it easier and faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the wiki link for Debian Installer Preseeding &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed&lt;/a&gt; .
Preseeding is  like a set of answers to debian-installer(d-i)  questions.Preseeding can be done in 3 ways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.Adding the preseed file to installer&amp;rsquo;s initrd.gz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.Over webserver via DHCP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.Loading the preseed file from a webserver over the boot options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post explains automating the debian installer by loading the preseed file from a webserver over the boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Graphical Installer boot menu appears after booting through the Debian iso,select the  &lt;code&gt;Help&lt;/code&gt; entry from the menu.
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/automate-debian-installer-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;AutomateDebianInstaller1&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After selecting the &lt;code&gt;Help&lt;/code&gt;  entry from boot menu,a &lt;code&gt;boot:&lt;/code&gt;  prompt is displayed below, enter you webserver url of the preseed file, in my case the preseed file was on my server with ip &lt;code&gt;http://144.24.135.168/preseed.cfg/&lt;/code&gt;, and give &lt;code&gt; boot: auto url=http://144.24.135.168/preseed.cfg&lt;/code&gt; and  the &lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt;  command launchs the automated debian installer.
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/automate-debian-installer-2.png&#34; alt=&#34;AutomateDebianInstaller2&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default preseed file for new release will be updated here &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed#Default_preseed_files&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed#Default_preseed_files&lt;/a&gt;
Answers like setting username and password for Account setup,Network Configuration,Mirror Settings,Partitioning disks,setting normal user as root user Locales,Keyboard layout,Package Selection and many more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the features in the Debian installer can be answered with the preseed file.
&lt;img src=&#34;/images/automate-debian-installer-3.png&#34; alt=&#34;AutomateDebianInstaller3&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;code-block relative mt-6 first:mt-0 group/code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;filename&#34;&gt;My Preseed file&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;d-i mirror/http/hostname string http.us.debian.org

&lt;p&gt;In the above preseed file i&amp;rsquo;ve set the debian mirrors [ line 1-3 ]with &lt;code&gt;http.us.debian.org&lt;/code&gt;  and the directory for the mirror is &lt;code&gt; /debian&lt;/code&gt;,Account setup with password[ line 4-8 ], [ line 9 ] for ntp server to sync time with and [ line 10 ] for automatically partitioning the disk with biggest free space disk partition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is sample preseed file with few options and it can be customized accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h1&gt;Debian&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debian is a GNU/Linux distribution completely inclinded towards Free Software philosophy, maintained by the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before talking about how i started contributing to debian, i would like to talk about the camp organized by FSCI
It is an online free mentorship programme organized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://fsci.in&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Free Software Community of India&lt;/a&gt; ,introducing people
to Free Software.&lt;a href=&#34;https://ravish0007.github.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ravish&lt;/a&gt; introduced me to 2021 &lt;a href=&#34;https://camp.fsci.in&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FSCI&amp;rsquo;s camp&lt;/a&gt;, and there i
got introduced to Debian Packaging through &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Debian Developers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Debian Maintainers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the project phase of the camp, i choosed to work on Debian Packaging and System Administration(here is my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://git.fosscommunity.in/community/camp/-/wikis/Proposals/Debian-Packaging-and-System-Administration/Vinay-Keshava&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Project Proposal&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Debian Packages and my Story !!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debian has roughly over 51,000 packages, these packages are installable through apt, just like &amp;ldquo;sudo apt install nano&amp;rdquo;.
I always wanted to know how &amp;ldquo;sudo apt install nano&amp;rdquo; works !.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the project phase of the camp &lt;a href=&#34;https://social.masto.host/@praveen&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Praveen&lt;/a&gt; my mentor of the project,a &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Debian Developer&lt;/a&gt; himself
suggested to get started by packaging node packages(dependencies of &lt;a href=&#34;https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/gitlab&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gitlab&lt;/a&gt;).
A big Thanks to praveen for teaching packaging from scratch, also answering my useless questions and also sponsoring my packages to debian.
Initially i found it very difficult to understand it,but the community was so welcoming, they were helping and assisting me by clearing all my doubts through matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a lot of time to learn,tried to spend more time in learning  during hectic schedule of college and also i gave up hope many times and restarted it.
So initial task was to setup the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Debian Unstable environment &lt;/a&gt; and rebuilding the existing simple node-pretty-ms package, and then tried a simple
package update and then went to continue packaging few node modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently &lt;a href=&#34;https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=vinaykeshava@disroot.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;maintain&lt;/a&gt; around two node modules as of today, looking forward to maintain more packages in debian.
All the communication happens mainly through mailing list or irc of respective &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/Teams&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;teams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Further Development&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to contribute and hangout with the awesome debian community and learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
